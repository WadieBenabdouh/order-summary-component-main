### What I learned

Flexbox is really a flexible way of laying out your webpage, I did not even need to write media query for the responsive design, also it took me less than 1 hour to recreate this design

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
main .container{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    margin-top: 2em;
    /* outline: 2px solid red; */
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    background-color: #fff;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```

## Acknowledgments

Don't underestimate the power of Flexbox, as like you can see I did the whole layout by using it, no CSS Grid was used anywhere.
